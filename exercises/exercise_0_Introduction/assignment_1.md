# 1. HOW munch does it cost

## a. You have a simple workload that runs daily in snowflake. The workloads uses 0.5. credits per day. Calculate the total credit usage and cost for a 30-day month.

### Solution:
15 credits

# b. Your workload varies throughout the moth. For the first 10 days, you use 2 credits per day. For the next 10 days, you use 1.5 credits per day. And for the last 10 days, you use 1 credit per day. Calculate the total credit usage and cost for 30-day moth.

### solution:
45 credits


# c. You have three different warehouse running workloads simultaneously. Warehouse A is of XS, warehouse B is size S, and warehouse C is size M. Warehouse A is used for 10/day, B is used for 2h/day and C is used for 1h/day. Calculate the total monthly cost assuming each warehouse runs for the full 30-day mothly.

### Solution:

540 credits


# d. Your Snowflake warehouse uses auto-scaling. For the first 10-days, it operates on 2 cluster for 10 hours per day. For the next 10 days, it scale up to 3 cluster for 10 hours per day. For the last 10 days, it scale up to 4 cluster s for 10 hours per day. Calculate the total monthly budget. Assume the warehouse consume 1 credit per hour per cluster.

### Solution:
